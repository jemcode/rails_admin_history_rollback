[RailsAdmin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin) extension for enabling users to easily visualise and revert their history audit created by the [PaperTrail](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail) gem.

## Installation

To enable **rails_admin_history_rollback**, add the following to your `Gemfile` ensuring it is added *after* rails_admin:

```ruby
gem 'rails_admin'
gem 'rails_admin_history_rollback'
```

It should go without saying that this plugin also requires the paper_trail gem.

E.g. `gem 'paper_trail'`


## Configuration
Simply enable paper_trail on your model `--with-changes --with-associations` and set up as usual by following the [paper_trail](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail) instructions.

```bash
rails generate paper_trail:install --with-changes --with-associations
```

In the `rails_admin.rb` initializer, uncomment the following lines to enable auditing:

```ruby
history_index
history_show
```

## Notes

You may also need to `require "paper_trail"` in `application.rb`

As pointed out in issue [#8](https://github.com/rikkipitt/rails_admin_history_rollback/issues/8), `paper_trail` master branch and release [v5.0.0](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#500-unreleased) (when available) causes session issues. Login is reset by devise; `paper_trail` tries to access to the `current_user` variable before `devise` ([airblade/paper_trail#556](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail#556)).

The fix is to manually add `set_paper_trail_whodunnit` before_action as advised here: (https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail#finding-out-who-was-responsible-for-a-change)

Paper trial `changeset` returns a nil value, and therefor the popup widget will be black. To fix this add

```
config.active_record.use_yaml_unsafe_load = true
```
in `config/application.rb` as discussed in here: (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72970170/upgrading-to-rails-6-1-6-1-causes-psychdisallowedclass-tried-to-load-unspecif)

```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  [...]
  before_action :set_paper_trail_whodunnit
  [...]
end
```
